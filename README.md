# ArchGaps
## Fully-riced i3-gaps setup for Arch Linux, focusing on minimalism. For aesthetic developers.

Custom instructions for installation are provided too but refer to [the wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) as strictly as possible as each build is different. I am not responsible for any potential damage caused using this setup. The installation instructions are just for my computer and should be used solely as a reference point.
