# ArchGaps
## Fully-riced i3-gaps setup for Arch Linux
Focused on minimalism, for aesthetic developers.

Custom instructions for installation are provided but please refer to [the official wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) as strictly as possible as each build is different. 

I am not responsible for any potential damage caused using this setup. The installation instructions are customised for my computer and should be used solely as a reference point.

**IMPORTANT**: Please setup internet connection on live ISO *before* running the installation script. Verify connection by pinging `archlinux.org`.

Special thanks to [ArchMatic](https://github.com/johnynfulleffect/ArchMatic) for the inspiration for this project.
